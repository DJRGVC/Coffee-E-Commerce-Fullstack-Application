# Description

Coffeemaker is a web application simulating a e-commerce platform. The user can:
1. Add ingredients to inventory with name and amount.
2. Edit inventory ingredients (delete, change name, change amount)
3. Add recipes consisting of a name, price, ingredient list, and amount of each ingredient.
4. Edit recipes (price, amount of each ingredient, add new ingredients)
5. Make a recipe with a given payment

The application follows MVC architecture and is guided by the [use cases](https://github.com/DJRGVC/Coffee-E-Commerce-Fullstack-Application/wiki/Use-Cases) created.
